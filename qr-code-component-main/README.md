# QR Code Component

This is a simple HTML and CSS project I built to practice basic layout and styling.  

The goal was to create a clean, centered card that displays a QR code, a heading, and a short paragraph.

- Used a mobile-first approach with a fixed-width card layout

- Centered the card using Flexbox on the body element

- Applied padding, border-radius, and box-shadow to give the card a polished look

- Imported a Google Font for better typography

- Made sure the image scales nicely inside the container
