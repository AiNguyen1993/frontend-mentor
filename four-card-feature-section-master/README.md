# ðŸ§© Four Card Feature Section

This is a layout-focused HTML and CSS project I built to practice multi-column design and responsive styling.  
The goal was to create a clean section with four feature cards, each highlighting a different aspect of a service or product.

- Structured the layout using semantic HTML elements
- Used Flexbox and media queries to create a responsive grid
- Styled each card with consistent spacing, shadows, and border accents
- Applied color-coded borders to visually group the cards
- Focused on clean typography and visual hierarchy
