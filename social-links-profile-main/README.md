# üåê Social Links Profile

This is a small HTML and CSS project I built to create a personal profile card with links to my social media accounts.  
It‚Äôs a great way to practice layout, styling, and component structure while building something I can actually use to share my online presence.

- Structured the profile using semantic HTML elements
- Styled the layout with Flexbox for vertical alignment
- Used consistent spacing, font sizes, and colors for a clean look
- Added hover effects to make the social links interactive
- Personalized the content with my name, avatar, and social handles
