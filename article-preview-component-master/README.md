# ðŸ“° Article Preview Component

This is a responsive HTML and CSS project I built to practice layout structure and interactive UI elements.  
The goal was to create a clean article card with a title, description, author info, and a share icon that reveals additional options.

- Structured the layout using semantic HTML elements
- Used Flexbox for alignment and spacing across sections
- Styled the card with consistent padding, shadows, and rounded corners
- Implemented a share icon that toggles visibility of social links
- Focused on hover and active states for interactive feedback
