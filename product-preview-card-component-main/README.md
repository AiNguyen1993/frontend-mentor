# üõçÔ∏è Product Preview Card Component

This is a responsive HTML and CSS project I built to practice layout design, typography, and mobile-first styling.  
The goal was to create a product card that displays an image, product details, pricing, and a call-to-action button‚Äîall styled cleanly and responsively.

- Used semantic HTML to structure the card content
- Applied Flexbox and media queries to make the layout responsive
- Styled the typography with custom fonts and consistent spacing
- Designed a hover effect for the button to improve interactivity
- Focused on visual hierarchy and clean alignment
