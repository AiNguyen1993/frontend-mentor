# \# Frontend Mentor Practice Projects

# 

# This repository contains my solutions to challenges from \[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).  

# I'm using these projects to improve my HTML and CSS skills through hands-on practice.

# 

# Each folder inside this repo is a separate challenge, ranging from beginner to advanced.  

# I aim to write clean, modular code and learn more about layout, responsiveness, and design best practices as I go.

# 

# Feel free to explore the folders and see how I approached each challenge!
