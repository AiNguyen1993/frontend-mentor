# üç≥ Recipe Page

This is a simple HTML and CSS project I built to practice writing semantic, well-structured markup.  
The goal was to create a clean and readable recipe layout using the most appropriate HTML elements for each section.

- Used semantic tags like `<div>`, `<table>`, `<ul>`, and `<footer>` to organize content
- Styled the layout with consistent spacing, font choices, and color palette
- Focused on accessibility and readability by using proper heading levels and list structures
- Kept the design minimal and content-focused
