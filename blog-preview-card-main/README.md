# \# Blog Preview Card

# 

# This is a simple HTML and CSS project I created to practice layout fundamentals and visual styling.  

# The goal was to build a clean, centered card that previews a blog post with an image, category tag, title, description, and author info.

# 

# \- Structured the layout using semantic HTML elements

# \- Styled the card using Flexbox and the box model

# \- Applied consistent spacing, font sizes, and colors for visual hierarchy

# \- Used `:hover` effects to make the title interactive

# \- Imported a custom font for better typography
