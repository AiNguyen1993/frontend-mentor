# ðŸ§¾ Testimonials Grid Section

This is a layout-focused HTML and CSS project I built to practice CSS Grid and responsive design.  
The goal was to create a testimonial section with multiple cards arranged in a visually balanced grid layout.

- Structured the content using semantic HTML elements
- Used CSS Grid to position and size testimonial cards across different screen sizes
- Applied consistent spacing, shadows, and border-radius for a clean card design
- Styled each testimonial with unique background colors and text hierarchy
- Focused on accessibility and readability across devices
